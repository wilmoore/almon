## FAQ

> Why use PHP to parse a server log instead of something more appropriate like [Fail2ban][]?

Normally, I would use [Fail2ban][] for this type of project; however, this is a fun excercise and an excuse to show off test driven development and multi-paradigm (class-based and procedural) development in PHP.

> Why did you use raw PDO instead of an ORM or higher-level database abstraction layer?

Because this project is extremely self-contained; thus, raw PDO was good enough for the task at hand.

> In that case, why use a mailer library? Why not use the raw PHP `mail` function?

Because the PHP mail interface is extremely low-level and this is very apparent when it comes to authenticating with an external SMTP server.  In this case, there is a lot of value added in introducing a library.

> I see tests coverage for `lib/Line`; however, what about everything else under `lib`?

Diminishing returns...

> Why not distribute this as a phar archive?

I considered it; however, given this is an internal-use tool and not delivered to a client, there was little incentive. That being said, we could always look at it as a future enhancement.

> Why does this not work on windows?

This script is currently only tested on unix-like (i.e. POSIX) systems such as Linux, *BSD. This means, it should work on your macbook, but not on a windows 7 machine. Sorry...time trade-off.
